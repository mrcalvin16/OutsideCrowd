              OutsideCrowd provides technology that helps organizers publish and
              manage events and helps attendees discover and purchase tickets.
              Organizers control their event content, admission rules, scheduling,
              fulfillment, and organizer-specific policies. Unless expressly stated,
              OutsideCrowd is not the event organizer or venue operator.
